Week 4

This week I started reading the Docs on Framework7 official website. Since I am absolutely new to this framework 
which uses Javascript and HTML I had to start from the very begining.

In particular I read about App HTML Layout, which turned out to be different for Ios and Android, 
eventhough this is a hybrid framework. I also read about Views which might include Side menu, tabs etc.
I read about Pages which are esentially the 'screens' the user sees in his/her mobile device.

After reading all of these I tried them out on my computer using some ready made codes from the website and tried understanding
what each css class does in the code snippets. 

At the end, using the web browser of my mobile device, I visited the folder on my computer, using the localhost address. I did
this in order to test how the pages would look on a real mobile device, as I was concerned for the responsiveness of the app, 
but so far it looked pretty tidy.
