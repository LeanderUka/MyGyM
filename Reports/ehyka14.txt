Week 4
 
During this week I have been learning from tutorials about Framework7.It was a very nice tool to make apps for Android or IOS.
After this we try at localhost/FrameworkMobile for watching  and i saw some sample for some very nice features.
With the tutorials I learned about its components: navbars,toolbars,buttons,swiper slider,infinite scroll,notifications etc.
