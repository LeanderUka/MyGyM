During the 4th week I got familiar with one of the technologies that we will use to build our application Framework7. I read tutorials about:

Framework7 components: navbars,toolbars,buttons,swiper slider,infinite scroll,notifications etc.
Framework7 styling: provides different color themes to costumize the app
Framework7 Fast Clicks library : active state,tap hold event,touch ripple
